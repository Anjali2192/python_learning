# python_learning

This repository showcases my Python learning journey and projects. Each script demonstrates my ability to write clean, functional, and well-structured Python code.

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

  The number_guess.py script is a simple yet fun game where the computer randomly selects a number and the player has to guess it.

### FeaturesðŸª¶

  * Random number generation within a given range
  * User input validation
  * Feedback on each guess ("too high" / "too low")
  * Counts the number of attempts until the correct guess

### How to RunðŸš€

  1. Clone this repository
  2. Run the script

## Future PlansðŸ”®

  I will keep adding more Python projects to this repository covering:

  * Games & mini-projects
  * API usage
  * Automation scripts
  * Data handling
