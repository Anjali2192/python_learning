# python_learning

This repository showcases my Python learning journey and projects. Each script demonstrates my ability to write clean, functional, and well-structured Python code.

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game 🎲

  The number_guess.py script is a simple yet fun game where the computer randomly selects a number and the player has to guess it.

### Features🪶

  * Random number generation within a given range
  * User input validation
  * Feedback on each guess ("too high" / "too low")
  * Counts the number of attempts until the correct guess

## Project 2: Adding two matrices➕

  The matrix_add.py script performs addition of two matrices.

### Features🪶

  * Validates dimensions to ensure matrices can be added
  * Outputs the resulting matrix in a clean format

## Project 3: Unique Characters Checker 🔤

  The unique_chars.py script checks whether all characters in a given string are unique.

### Features🪶

  * Counts character frequency using a dictionary
  * Detects if any character is repeated
  * Prints whether the string has all unique characters or  not

### Example Usage🪴

  Input string: apple          
  {'a': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}                  
  All characters are not unique

## Project 4: Date and Time ⏰

The datetime_example.py script uses Python’s datetime module to display the current date and time.

### Features🪶

  * Prints today’s date
  * Prints current time
  * Displays formatted date-time string

## Project 5: Dice art 🎲

The dice_art.py script uses random module to generate 2-D dices and total value of all the dices.

### Features🪶

  * User input validation
  * Displays randomly generated 2-D dices
  * shows total value of all the dices

## How to Run🚀

  1. Clone this repository
  2. Run the script

## Future Plans🔮

  I will keep adding more Python projects to this repository covering:

  * Games & mini-projects
  * API usage
  * Automation scripts
  * Data handling
