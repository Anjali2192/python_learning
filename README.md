# python_learning

This repository showcases my Python learning journey and projects. Each script demonstrates my ability to write clean, functional, and well-structured Python code.

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

  The number_guess.py script is a simple yet fun game where the computer randomly selects a number and the player has to guess it.

### FeaturesðŸª¶

  * Random number generation within a given range
  * User input validation
  * Feedback on each guess ("too high" / "too low")
  * Counts the number of attempts until the correct guess

## Project 2: Adding two matricesâž•

  The matrix_add.py script performs addition of two matrices.

### FeaturesðŸª¶

  * Validates dimensions to ensure matrices can be added
  * Outputs the resulting matrix in a clean format

## Project 3: Unique Characters Checker ðŸ”¤

  The unique_chars.py script checks whether all characters in a given string are unique.

### FeaturesðŸª¶

  * Counts character frequency using a dictionary
  * Detects if any character is repeated
  * Prints whether the string has all unique characters or  not

### Example UsageðŸª´

  Input string: apple
  {'a': 1, 'p': 2, 'l': 1, 'e': 1}
  All characters are not unique


## How to RunðŸš€

  1. Clone this repository
  2. Run the script

## Future PlansðŸ”®

  I will keep adding more Python projects to this repository covering:

  * Games & mini-projects
  * API usage
  * Automation scripts
  * Data handling
